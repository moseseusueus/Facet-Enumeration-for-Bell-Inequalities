# Facet enumeration problem for Bell inequalities
### `facet-enumeration-for-bell-inequalities`

This repository aims to expose the data about the facet enumeration problem for bell inequalities. Here we use the [lrs library](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrs.html) for reverse search algorithm in vertex enumeration/convex hull problems.

The folder `Examples` contain the examples for the CHSH and the CH inequalities. Also, one can find the most important functions required to make the analysis for generating vertex in the `important-functions.ipynb` file. These functions are really important and widely used in this repository.
